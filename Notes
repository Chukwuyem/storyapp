Loading the homepage

Querying the database from server side vs client side

server side:
Query database in homeController.js.
Stories are rendered using "{{#each Story}} {{/each}}" template.
Disadvantage: This would load the whole story table at once.
Being that this is on the homepage, we want to show the user a little at a time.
Like a timeline, where if you go to the load, you could "Load More..."
If we put a limit on the query in order to achieve this, the page will to be re-rendered when a new
	query is called.
	
Client side: [IN USE]
Query database in homepage.js
Stories are rendered with jquery on the client side.
This helps us control how much we show the user while being able to load more stories without re-rendering the 
	whole page.

Story to Paragraph relationship.

Initial idea:
Each paragraph references story.
Each paragraph has a column for whether its a head or not (i.e. the first para in a story).
Head paragraphs would be called with a "...WHERE stid={story id} AND head= TRUE..."

Alternate idea: [IN USE]
Each story has a headpara column.
This would mean a circular reference where the story table references para table and vice versa.
Now, paragraphs can be called with a simple "...WHERE prid={paragraph id}..."
